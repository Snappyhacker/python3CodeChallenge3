# Python Coding Assessment

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to a series of Python programming tasks designed to test fundamental concepts such as functions, decorators, sequences, sets, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming.

## Contents

1. **Functions**
   - `add_numbers(num1, num2)`: Returns the sum of two numbers.
   - `is_even(number)`: Returns `True` if the number is even, `False` otherwise.
   - `reverse_string(text)`: Returns the reversed version of the input string.
   - `count_vowels(text)`: Returns the count of vowels in the input string.
   - `calculate_factorial(n)`: Returns the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`.
   - `apply_decorator(func)`: Applies a decorator that prints a message before calling the function.
   - `sort_by_age(data)`: Sorts a list of tuples by age in ascending order.
   - `merge_dicts(dict1, dict2)`: Merges two dictionaries with summed values for common keys.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming**
   - `Car`: A class representing a car with attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`, and a method `display_info` to print car details.
